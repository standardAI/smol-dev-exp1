1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will be linked from the "index.html" file and will override or complement the styles from "tailwind.css". It will use the same id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html".

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked from the "index.html" file and will provide the base styles for the website. It will use the same id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html".

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are shared between all three files as they are used to apply styles and potentially manipulate elements with JavaScript.

2. CSS Classes: These are the class names defined in "tailwind.css" and potentially "styles.css". They are shared between the HTML and CSS files as they are used to apply styles to HTML elements.

3. CSS Selectors: These are the identifiers used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" to select and style HTML elements. They are shared between the HTML and CSS files.

4. File References: The "index.html" file will have references (links) to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This is a dependency as the HTML file needs to know the location of the CSS files to apply the styles.

Note: As per the user's prompt, there is no mention of JavaScript, exported variables, data schemas, message names, or function names. Therefore, these are not included in the shared dependencies.
